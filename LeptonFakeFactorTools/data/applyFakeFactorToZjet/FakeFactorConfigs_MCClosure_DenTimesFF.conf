# For estimating Z+jet in the SR, based on the fake factors previously derived.
# Here, we will take the CR identical to the SR other than an AntiID lepton,
# and apply the fake factor to it in order to obtain the Z+jet SR estimate.
# Note that the ttbar SFs previously derived must be used here, to ensure that
# the ttbar can be properly subtracted in the SR. Also note that this must be run
# with all three of the ltt, tlt, and ttl configurations.
#
# This conf is applicable for the electrons and muons from the 2015 SMWZ analysis
