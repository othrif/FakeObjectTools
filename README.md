Fake Object Tools 

This repository gathers several tools to estimate the fake lepton and charge flip background estimation in the SUSY group.
The tools currently available: 
* Dynamic Matrix Method for fake leptons
* MC-template Method
* Fake Factor Method

Also frameworks which can be used (as an example) to measure fake rates and real efficiencies for the Matrix Method. 

More details are given in the dedicated README file(s), and later in the twiki page:
